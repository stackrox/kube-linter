# KubeLinter

KubeLinter is a static analysis tool that checks Kubernetes YAML files and Helm charts to ensure the applications represented in them adhere to best practices.

KubeLinter accepts YAML files as input and runs a series of checks on them.
If it finds any issues, it reports them and returns a non-zero exit
code.

KubeLinter is:
- **Configurable**: includes multiple built-in checks which you can enable or
  disable.
- **Extensible**: you can define and configure custom checks.

## Installation

If you have [Go](https://golang.org/) installed, run the following command:

```bash
GO111MODULE=on go get golang.stackrox.io/kube-linter/cmd/kube-linter
```
Otherwise, download the latest binary from
[Releases](https://github.com/stackrox/kube-linter/releases) and add it to your
PATH.

### Building from source

> **NOTE**: Before you build, make sure that you have [installed
> Go](https://golang.org/doc/install).

To build KubeLinter from source, follow these instructions:

1. Clone the KubeLinter repository.
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:stackrox/kube-linter.git
   ```
1. Run the `make build` command. This command compiles the source code and
   creates `kube-linter` binary files for each platform in the `.gobin` folder.

## Usage

1. Consider the following sample pod specification file `pod.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Pod
   metadata:
     name: security-context-demo
   spec:
     securityContext:
       runAsUser: 1000
       runAsGroup: 3000
       fsGroup: 2000
     volumes:
     - name: sec-ctx-vol
       emptyDir: {}
     containers:
     - name: sec-ctx-demo
       image: busybox
       resources:
         requests:
           memory: "64Mi"
           cpu: "250m"
       command: [ "sh", "-c", "sleep 1h" ]
       volumeMounts:
       - name: sec-ctx-vol
         mountPath: /data/demo
       securityContext:
         allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
   ```
1. To lint this file with KubeLinter, run the following command:
   ```bash
   kube-linter lint pod.yaml
   ```
1. KubeLinter runs the default checks and reports errors.
   ```
   pod.yaml: (object: <no namespace>/security-context-demo /v1, Kind=Pod) container "sec-ctx-demo" does not have a read-only root file system (check: no-read-only-root-fs, remediation: Set readOnlyRootFilesystem to true in your container's securityContext.)

   pod.yaml: (object: <no namespace>/security-context-demo /v1, Kind=Pod) container    "sec-ctx-demo" has cpu limit 0 (check: unset-cpu-requirements, remediation: Set    your container's CPU requests and limits depending on its requirements. See    https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/   #requests-and-limits for more details.)
   
   pod.yaml: (object: <no namespace>/security-context-demo /v1, Kind=Pod) container    "sec-ctx-demo" has memory limit 0 (check: unset-memory-requirements, remediation:    Set your container's memory requests and limits depending on its requirements.    See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/   #requests-and-limits for more details.)
   
   Error: found 3 lint errors
   ```
