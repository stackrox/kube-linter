# What is KubeLinter?

KubeLinter analyzes Kubernetes YAML files and Helm charts, and checks them against a variety of best practices, with a focus on production readiness and security. 

KubeLinter runs sensible default checks, designed to give you useful information about your Kubernetes YAML files and Helm charts. This is to help teams check early and often for security misconfigurations and DevOps best practices. Some common examples of these include running containers as a non-root user, enforcing least privilege, and storing sensitive information only in secrets.

KubeLinter is configurable, so you can enable and disable checks, as well as create your own custom checks, depending on the policies you want to follow within your organization. 

When a lint check fails, KubeLinter reports recommendations for how to resolve any potential issues and returns a non-zero exit code.

## Documentation
Visit https://docs.kubelinter.io for detailed documentation on installing, using and configuring KubeLinter.

## Installing KubeLinter

### Using Go

To install using [Go](https://golang.org/), run the following command:

```bash
GO111MODULE=on go get golang.stackrox.io/kube-linter/cmd/kube-linter
```
Otherwise, download the latest binary from [Releases](https://github.com/stackrox/kube-linter/releases) and add it to your
PATH.

### Using Homebrew for macOS or LinuxBrew for Linux

To install using Homebrew or LinuxBrew, run the following command:

```bash
brew install kube-linter
```

### Building from source

### Prerequisites
- Make sure that you have [installed Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) prior to building from source.

### Building KubeLinter

Installing KubeLinter from source is as simple as following these steps:

1. First, clone the KubeLinter repository.

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:stackrox/kube-linter.git
   ```
   
1. Then, complile the source code. This will create the kube-linter binary files for each platform and places them in the `.gobin` folder.
   
   ```bash
   make build
   ```
   
1. Finally, you are ready to start using KubeLinter. Verify your version to ensure you've successfully installed KubeLinter.

   ```bash
   .gobin/kube-linter version
   ```

## Using KubeLinter

### Local YAML Linting

Running KubeLinter to Lint your YAML files only requires two steps in its most basic form.

1. Locate the YAML file you'd like to test for security and production readiness best practices:
1. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   kube-linter lint /path/to/your/yaml.yaml
   ```

### Example

Consider the following sample pod specification file `pod.yaml`. This file has two production readiness issues and one security issue:

**Security Issue:**
1. The container in this pod is not running as a read only file system, which could allow it to write to the root filesystem.

**Production readiness:**
1. The container's CPU requests and limits are not set, which could allow it to consume excessive CPU.
1. The container's memory requests and limits are not set, which could allow it to consume excessive memory

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Pod
   metadata:
     name: security-context-demo
   spec:
     securityContext:
       runAsUser: 1000
       runAsGroup: 3000
       fsGroup: 2000
     volumes:
     - name: sec-ctx-vol
       emptyDir: {}
     containers:
     - name: sec-ctx-demo
       image: busybox
       resources:
         requests:
           memory: "64Mi"
           cpu: "250m"
       command: [ "sh", "-c", "sleep 1h" ]
       volumeMounts:
       - name: sec-ctx-vol
         mountPath: /data/demo
       securityContext:
         allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
   ```
  
1. Copy the YAML above to pod.yaml and lint this file by running the following command:

   ```bash
   kube-linter lint pod.yaml
   ```
1. KubeLinter runs its default checks and reports recommendations. Below is the output from our previous command.

   ```
   pod.yaml: (object: <no namespace>/security-context-demo /v1, Kind=Pod) container "sec-ctx-demo" does not have a read-only root file system (check: no-read-only-root-fs, remediation: Set readOnlyRootFilesystem to true in your container's securityContext.)

   pod.yaml: (object: <no namespace>/security-context-demo /v1, Kind=Pod) container "sec-ctx-demo" has cpu limit 0 (check: unset-cpu-requirements, remediation: Set    your container's CPU requests and limits depending on its requirements. See    https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/   #requests-and-limits for more details.)
   
   pod.yaml: (object: <no namespace>/security-context-demo /v1, Kind=Pod) container "sec-ctx-demo" has memory limit 0 (check: unset-memory-requirements, remediation:    Set your container's memory requests and limits depending on its requirements.    See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/   #requests-and-limits for more details.)
   
   Error: found 3 lint errors
   ```
