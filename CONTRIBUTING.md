## Contributing to KubeLinter

Thank you for your interest in contributing to KubeLinter!

### Code Contributions

We welcome code contributions from the community. Anyone is welcome to create a pull request,
and request a review from any of the project maintainers.

By default, your pull requests should be linked to an [issue](https://github.com/stackrox/kube-linter/issues).
If you're addressing an existing issue, great! If your change is unrelated to an existing issue,
please file an issue first, and make sure you get buy-in from the maintainers.

However, if your change is relatively trivial (say, a documentation update, or a simple bugfix),
feel free to directly create a pull request, and explain your changes in the pull request.

### Feature Requests and Bug Reports

If you find a bug, or have a request for a feature,
please [create a GitHub issue](https://github.com/stackrox/kube-linter/issues/new/choose).
