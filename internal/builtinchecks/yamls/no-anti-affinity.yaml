description: "Alert on deployments with multiple replicas that don't specify inter pod anti-affinity to ensure that the orchestrator attempts to schedule replicas on different nodes"
remediation: >-
  Specify anti-affinity in your pod spec to ensure that the orchestrators attempts to schedule replicas on different nodes.
  You can do this by using podAntiAffinity, specifying a labelSelector that matches pods of this deployment,
  and setting the topologyKey to kubernetes.io/hostname.
  See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#inter-pod-affinity-and-anti-affinity for more details.
